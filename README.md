### Course Roadmap: how to address predictive business problem
![Methodology](http://www.helloxueliu.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/1.-methodology-map.jpg)
Predicting outcomes involves advanced analytic techniques, differentiating itself from data analysis in terms of geospatial, segmentation, aggregation or descriptive. 
The first step to address a predictive business problem is to understand the business decision and data richness. The roadmap has shown different business decision scenarios and appropriate models for each scenario. The projects are hands-on practices dealing with business problems simulated to the real world.

### Part 1: [Problem Solving with Advanced Analytics by Alteryx](https://www.udacity.com/course/problem-solving-with-advanced-analytics--ud976)
Learn a structured framework for solving problems with advanced analytics. Learn to select the most appropriate analytical methodology. Learn linear regression.

- Project: [Predicting Diamond Prices]
- Project: [Predicting Catalog Demand]

### Part 2: [Creating an Analytical Dataset by Alteryx](https://www.udacity.com/course/creating-an-analytical-dataset--ud977)
Understand the most common data types. Understand the various sources of data. Make adjustments to dirty data to prepare a dataset. Identify and adjust for outliers. Learn to write queries to extract and analyze data from a relational database.

- Project: [Data Cleanup]
- Project: [Create Report from Database (SQL)]

### Part 3: [Data Visualization in Tableau](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-visualization-in-tableau--ud1006)
Understand the importance of data visualization. Know how different data types are encoded in visualizations. Select the most effective chart or graph based on the data being displayed.

- Project: [Visualizing Movie Data]

### Part 4: [Classification Models by Alteryx](https://www.udacity.com/course/classification-models--ud978)
You will use classification models, such as logistic regression, decision tree, forest, and boosted, to make predictions of binary and non-binary outcomes.

- Project: [Predicting Default Risk]

### Part 5: [A/B Testing](https://www.udacity.com/course/ab-testing--ud979)
Understand the fundamentals of A/B testing, including experimental design, variable selection, and analyzing and interpreting results.

- Project: [A/B Test a New Menu Launch]

### Part 6: [Time Series Forecasting](https://www.udacity.com/course/time-series-forecasting--ud980)
Understand trend, seasonal, and cyclical behavior of time series data. Use time series decomposition plots. Build ETS and ARIMA models.

- Project: [Forecast Video Game Sales]

### Part 7: [Segmentation and Clustering](https://www.udacity.com/course/segmentation-and-clustering--ud981)
Understand the difference between localization, standardization, and segmentation. Scale data to prepare a dataset for cluster modeling. Use principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of variables for cluster model. Build and apply a k-centroid cluster model. Visualize and communicate the results of a cluster model.
Then complete a capstone project combining techniques learned throughout the program.

- Project: [Predictive Analytics Capstone]
