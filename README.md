### Course Roadmap: how to address predictive business problem
![Methodology](http://www.helloxueliu.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/1.-methodology-map.jpg)

Predicting outcomes involves advanced analytic techniques, differentiating itself from data analysis in terms of geospatial, segmentation, aggregation or descriptive. 
The first step to address a predictive business problem is to understand the business decision and data richness. The roadmap has shown different business decision scenarios and appropriate models for each scenario. The projects are hands-on practices dealing with business problems simulated to the real world.

### Part 1: [Problem Solving with Advanced Analytics by Alteryx](https://www.udacity.com/course/problem-solving-with-advanced-analytics--ud976)
Learn a structured framework for solving problems with advanced analytics. Learn to select the most appropriate analytical methodology. Learn linear regression.

- **Project [Predicting Diamond Prices]** A jewelry company wants to put in a bid to purchase a large set of diamonds, but is unsure how much it should bid. In this project, you will use the results from a predictive model to make a recommendation on how much the jewelry company should bid for the diamonds.
- **Project [Predict Sales for a Catalog Launch]** A home-goods manufacturer wants to predict expected profits from a catalog launch. You will apply a framework to work through the problem and build a linear regression model to provide results and a recommendation.


### Part 2: [Creating an Analytical Dataset by Alteryx](https://www.udacity.com/course/creating-an-analytical-dataset--ud977)
Understand the most common data types. Understand the various sources of data. Make adjustments to dirty data to prepare a dataset. Identify and adjust for outliers. Learn to write queries to extract and analyze data from a relational database.

- **Project [Data Cleanup]** A pet store chain is selecting the location for its next store. You will use data preparation techniques to build a robust analytic dataset and use it to build a predictive model to select the best location.
- **Project [Create Report from Database (SQL)]** Management wants some high level metrics about their organization. You will write SQL queries to extract and analyze data from a transactions database and prepare a set of visualizations.


### Part 3: [Data Visualization in Tableau](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-visualization-in-tableau--ud1006)
Understand the importance of data visualization. Know how different data types are encoded in visualizations. Select the most effective chart or graph based on the data being displayed.

- **Project [Visualizing Movie Data]** A movie producer wants to better understand film industry trends before releasing its next movie. You will explore a dataset and build Tableau dashboards to answer a set of questions and tell a story with data.


### Part 4: [Classification Models by Alteryx](https://www.udacity.com/course/classification-models--ud978)
You will use classification models, such as logistic regression, decision tree, forest, and boosted, to make predictions of binary and non-binary outcomes.

- **Project [Predicting Default Risk]** A bank recently received an influx of loan applications. You will build and apply a classification model to provide a recommendation on which loan applicants the bank should lend to.


### Part 5: [A/B Testing](https://www.udacity.com/course/ab-testing--ud979)
Understand the fundamentals of A/B testing, including experimental design, variable selection, and analyzing and interpreting results.

- **Project [A/B Test a New Menu Launch]** A chain of coffee shops is considering launching a new menu. You will design and analyze an A/B test and write up a recommendation on whether the chain should introduce the new menu.


### Part 6: [Time Series Forecasting](https://www.udacity.com/course/time-series-forecasting--ud980)
Understand trend, seasonal, and cyclical behavior of time series data. Use time series decomposition plots. Build ETS and ARIMA models.

- **Project[Forecast Video Game Sales]** A video game producer is planning production levels. You will use time series forecasting models to forecast monthly demand and provide a recommendation to help match supply to demand.


### Part 7: [Segmentation and Clustering](https://www.udacity.com/course/segmentation-and-clustering--ud981)
Understand the difference between localization, standardization, and segmentation. Scale data to prepare a dataset for cluster modeling. Use principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of variables for cluster model. Build and apply a k-centroid cluster model. Visualize and communicate the results of a cluster model.
Then complete a capstone project combining techniques learned throughout the program.

- **Project [Combine Predictive Techniques]** A grocery store chain is planning a significant expansion. You will use multiple analytical techniques to provide recommendations on where and how to expand. After completing the project, you will feel comfortable combining predictive techniques and delivering solutions to complex business problems.
